ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ Get ready for the Hackathon

Welcome to the Bridging the Gap Hackathon offered by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC-GIDA) at Imperial College London and the Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA). This page is to orient you to some of the pre-hackathon activities, computing resources and links to help you prepare:

* **Introduction to GitHub:** https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github
* **Git/Github for Beginners:** https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/github-and-git-tutorial-for-beginners
* **Access to the hackathon GitHub organization:** [`CEMA-MRC-Hackathon`](https://github.com/CEMA-MRC-Hackathon), which will have a repo for your team

### GitHub Repositories
A GitHub repository is a storage space for files, code, and revision histories on GitHub's servers. Repositories can be public or private, and they can have multiple collaborators.

**What are the benefits of GitHub repositories?**

* **Collaboration:** Repositories allow developers to work together on projects. 
* **Version control:** Repositories store all versions of files, making it easy to track changes and revert to previous versions. 
* **Project development:** Repositories can help improve project development by making it easier to combine changes.

### Steps

1. If you do not have one, please create a github account by visiting https://github.com
1. Activate "two factor authentication" (2FA) on your github account, using [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)

### GitHub is sending too many emails

Go to https://github.com/settings/notifications and:

* Untick **Automatically watch repositories**
* Untick **Email** under **Watching**
* Set up an email filter to collect all emails from `notifications@github.com` to be routed to a folder separate from your inbox (but still keep an eye on it)
